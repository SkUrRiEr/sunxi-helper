Sunxi Helper

This is a web application to assist people to add their boards to the
sunxi-boards and u-boot-sunxi repositories.

Rough layout:
memdump/	tools to parse memdumps
fex/		tools to parse fex/bin files
ui/		user interface

Commandline Tools:
parse_memdump.php	This reads in a text based memdump then re-emits it in the
			same format. This is a test of the parser tool.
